<h1>Digital Single Market</h1>
<h3>What does the EU's Digital Single Market Claim to be Aiming For?</h3>
<p>"The Digital Single Market aims to create the right environment and conditions for digital networks and services to flourish by providing high-speed, secure and trustworthy infrastructures and services supported by the right regulatory conditions.</p>
<p>Innovative digital services require the right environment to thrive. The Commission is creating the conditions for advanced infrastructures, proper regulatory conditions for investment in digital networks, and a level playing field between market players."</p>
<h3>Some Targets of the DSM</h3>
<ul>
<li>Overhaul of the telecom rules</li>
<li>Common broadband targets</li>
<li>Common framework of rules for audio and visual media</li>
<li>An assessment of the roles of online platforms and control of 'illegal' content</li>
<li>Increase trust in digital services and handling of personal data</li>
<li>Industry partnership on cybersecurity</li>
</ul>
<h3>Some Carrots</h3>
<ul>
<li>Foster 5G wireless technology</li>
<li>Public authorities to offer free Wi Fi access</li>
</ul>

<h3>Some Concerns About EU Copyright Directive</h3>
<ul>
<li>Threat to the ability to link</li>
<li>Blogging platforms threatened by excessive regulation</li>
<li>Censorship on discussion platforms</li>
<li>Broad requirements have unintended consequences like destroying live streaming through upload controls</li>
<li>Fair use is destroyed and creativity such as remixing is no longer possible</li>
<li>Parody, comedy and independent commentary is open to arbitrary control and attack</li>
<li>Sharing memes for humour or commentary is blocked by harsh regulation and automatic AI censorship of uploads</li>
<li>Code sharing platforms relying on uploading, sharing and open licences are threatened by requirements and copyright control only focused rules and automated controls.</li>
<li>Creativity and Free Speech on the internet under imminent threat</li>
<li>ISP's (private business) becomes internet police and copyright enforcers - who wins the smaller creator or large automated copyright claimers, if your creation gets 'hash' claimed by a corporation, what can a small creator do?</li>
<li>It causes platforms to defensively enforce preventative copyright control on users.</li>
<li>The wholly unrealistic expectations on AI technology to make draconian copyright control and equal for all</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Articles of Concern</h3>
<p>Article 11: Protection of Press Publications Concerning Digital Uses</p>
<p>The Commission has proposed introducing a new pan-European copyright for press publications, sometimes referred to as “ancillary copyright” or a “neighbouring right”, which would create new copyright for snippets of online content. That would mean anyone sharing a link with text, like a news headline or a short blurb about the article, could be charged a license fee from the publisher responsible for the content. These restrictions would last for 20 years.</p>
<p>Article 13: Use of protected content by information society service providers storing and giving access to large amounts of works and other subject-matter uploaded by their users.</p>
<p>This proposal throws the idea of balanced copyright out the window, as it would make all open platforms liable for the actions of their users, enforce a particular type of business model (e.g. licenses), and impose mandatory filters, all with no safeguards to preserve copyright exceptions, or the rights of users.</p>
<p>These measures would in practice require monitoring and filtering of everything that European citizens upload to content-sharing services from social media sites (like Twitter and Facebook), outlets for creative expression (like YouTube, DeviantArt, SoundCloud, and Tumblr), to informational sites (like Wikipedia and the Internet Archives), to open source software repositories (like GitHub). It would be the responsibility of these services to play judge, jury, and executioner for copyright enforcement — businesses large and small could be held liable for the content their users access and share.</p>
<p>This inverts the open source ethos where people can build and improve on each others’ creations. Once again the hand of proprietary copyright control is strengthened and use of a work in the creation of a new work would be blocked by default. Existing laws already strongly protect the rights holder, which isn't in dispute, and fair use only grants very limited rights to use the material of others for specific purposes - this doesn't include creating new works based on derivation, yet an enormous of creativity is done this way from fan art to spin off creations. This would all become blocked by default, copyright holders would become empowered not only to protect their works, but hold control over creativity inspired by their works.</p>
<p>Article 3: Text and Data Mining</p>
<p>Text and data mining (TDM) is the process of data analysis by machines to comb through large datasets and surface patterns, trends, and correlations. Like machine learning. The draft copyright directive proposes to add an exception that would allow TDM but only for research institutions, and only for scientific research, and only when those research institutions have lawful access for the purpose of scientific research. The proposed exception is too limited to realise the benefits of TDM for competitiveness, innovation and knowledge. It should include the many other stakeholders that use mining techniques to learn, read, and educate — people like independent researchers, advocacy groups, journalists, librarians, and startups. Outside of Europe is widely permitted, and has helped discover a range of new applications and innovations, without undermining core copyright protections.</p>
