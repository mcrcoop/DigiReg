<h1>GDPR</h1>
<p>EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU-GDPR) is enacted in the UK by the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/contents/enacted" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Protection Act 2018</a>.</p>
<h3>The Six Data Protection Principles</h3>
<p>1. Processing be lawful and fair</p>
<p>2. Purposes of processing be specified, explicit and legitimate</p>
<p>3. Personal data be adequate, relevant and not excessive</p>
<p>4. Personal data be accurate and kept up to date</p>
<p>5. Personal data be kept for no longer than is necessary</p>
<p>6. Personal data be processed in a secure manner</p>
<h3>Bullet List of Individual Rights to Their Information</h3>
<ul>
<li>Right to be informed.</li>
<li>Right to rectification.</li>
<li>Right of access to copies of information. </li>
<li>Right to erasure. </li>
<li>Right to limit how information is used.</li>
<li>Right to data portability. </li>
<li>Right not to be subject to automated decision-making.</li>
<li>Right to object to the use of data.</li>
<li>Right to raise a concern.</li>
<li>Right to access information held by a public body.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Complying with Data Protection</h2>
<h3>The 6 Lawful Bases for Processing Data</h3>
<p>1. Consent: the individual has given clear consent for you to process their personal data for a specific purpose. </p>
<p>2. Contract: the processing is necessary for a contract you have with the individual, or because they have asked you to take specific steps before entering into a contract. </p>
<p>3. Legal obligation: the processing is necessary for you to comply with the law (not including contractual obligations). </p>
<p>4. Vital interests: the processing is necessary to protect someone’s life. </p>
<p>5. Public task: the processing is necessary for you to perform a task in the public interest or for your official functions, and the task or function has a clear basis in law. </p>
<p>6. Legitimate interests: the processing is necessary for your legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party unless there is a good reason to protect the individual’s personal data which overrides those legitimate interests. (This cannot apply if you are a public authority processing data to perform your official tasks.) </p>
<h3>Special Note</h3>
<p>In general when considering use of personal data. The order of the reasons applied would basically be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Contract: providing the agreed service to the data subject</li>
<li>Legitimate interests: processing as part of your usual and necessary activities to provide legitimate services, products or participation in activities - such as education, communication, campaigning...</li>
<li>Consent: it should be noted you don't need to 'knee-jerk' to consent, you need to consider if 1. or 2. already permit holding and processing of the data you use.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Responsibilities of the Data Controller and Processor</h3>
<p>1. Informing and enabling the rights of a person should be done in plain language and made accessible. Such as warn and inform at the time data is collected, and enable easy access for the data subject to act on their rights.</p>
<p>2. Improve security and report data breaches where feasible to relevant authorities and where it might adversely affect individuals inform them promptly.</p>
<p>3. Implement the new expanded right such as 'right to be forgotten'. This means erasure of information when requested and when no longer needed for the purposes it was collected for.</p>
<p>4. Standard boilerplate policies will no longer suffice for compliance. Organisation and use relevant and specific policies will be required and where possible always alert individuals to their rights and how the data collector is complying with GDPR at the time data is collected.</p>
<p>5. Data controllers and processors need to be able to show active compliance, in how they inform individuals, in their reasons for collecting and using data, audit their data storage and processing and record data handling activities.</p>
<p>6. It is now clarified that the third parties handling data on behalf of a data controller, whether it's for processing or providing services - such as payment services, also need to be declared and covered by the organisations data policy. These third parties will also need to be compliant.</p>
<p>7. If your organisation uses individuals personal data, you likely need to pay a fee. There are some exemptions, but you will need to check: <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/data-protection-fee/">ICO Data Protection Fee</a>.</p>
<h3>6 Key Questions To Audit Use of Data</h3>
<p>1. What items of personal data are being captured about each person?</p>
<p>2. What purposes are these pieces of data being used?</p>
<p>3. How are they being processed, system, people and processes?</p>
<p>4. Where do they get shared with and for what purpose?</p>
<p>5. How are we going to record data processing activity?</p>
<p>6. What is the legal basis for holding this information?</p>
