<h2>Principles of Fair Use</h2>
<h3>The US Copyright Law - Fair Use Factors</h3>
<p>1. Purpose and character of the use</p>
<p>The first factor is "the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes." To justify the use as fair, one must demonstrate how it either advances knowledge or the progress of the arts through the addition of something new.</p>
<p>2. Nature of the copyrighted work</p>
<p>The availability of copyright protection should not depend on the artistic quality or merit of a work, fair use analyses consider certain aspects of the work to be relevant, such as whether it is fictional or non-fictional. To prevent the private ownership of work that rightfully belongs in the public domain, facts and ideas are not protected by copyright—only their particular expression or fixation merits such protection.</p>
<p>3. Amount and substantiality</p>
<p>The third factor assesses the amount and substantiality of the copyrighted work that has been used. In general, the less that is used in relation to the whole, the more likely the use will be considered fair.</p>
<p>4. Effect upon work's value</p>
<p>The fourth factor measures the effect that the allegedly infringing use has had on the copyright owner's ability to exploit his original work. The court not only investigates whether the defendant's specific use of the work has significantly harmed the copyright owner's market, but also whether such uses in general, if widespread, would harm the potential market of the original. The burden of proof here rests on the copyright owner, who must demonstrate the impact of the infringement on commercial use of the work.</p>

<h3>Fair Dealing In United Kingdom Law</h3>
<p>1. Research and study</p>
<p>Under Section 29(1) of the 1988 Act, fair dealing is a valid defence when dealing with copyright infringement for the purpose of non-commercial research or private study. This applies to "literary, dramatical, musical and artistic works, as well as with the typographical formats of published works"; it does not apply to infringement of broadcasts, sound recordings or film.</p>
<p>2. Criticism or Review</p>
<p>Section 30(1) of the 1988 Act provides that the fair dealing exception is valid if the material is being copied for criticism or review. For it to apply, the infringer must be able to show that the dealing was for criticism or review, that the infringed work was previously made available to the public, that the dealing was fair, and that the dealing was accompanied by an acknowledgement.</p>
<p>3. Reporting of current events</p>
<p>Under Section 30(2), fair dealing using any work for the purpose of reporting current events, with sufficient acknowledgement, is a valid exception to copyright. Photographs are excluded, however; Cornish, Llewelyn and Aplin write that this is "in order to preserve the full value of holding a unique visual record of some person or event". A crucial element of the "current events" exception is whether or not the reporting covers "current" events. "The older the issue, the less likely it is that it will be treated as having any currency".</p>
<p>4. Parody, caricature and pastiche</p>
<p>Section 30A provides for fair dealing as a defence in cases where the infringement was for the purpose of caricature, parody or pastiche. The Intellectual Property Office suggests that a "parody" is something that imitates a work for humorous or satirical effect, a "pastiche" is a composition that is made up of selections from various sources or one that imitates the style of another artist or period, and that a "caricature" is something that portrays its subject in a simplified or exaggerated way, whether insulting or complimentary and whether for a political purpose or solely for entertainment.</p>
<p>5. Quotation</p>
<p>Section 30A also broadened the scope of the fair dealing defence for the "quotation" of suitably acknowledged published works for the purposes of "criticism or review", to "criticism, review or otherwise."</p>
<p>Special Note</p>
<p>If a claim of copyright infringement is brought and the copyright holder seeks an interim injunction restricting publication, courts will not usually grant this if the defendant pleads fair dealing.</p>

<h2>Privacy</h2>
<h3>1. Article 12 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights:</h3>
<p>"No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks."</p>
<h3>2. US Four Torts of Privacy</h3>
<p>2.1 Intrusion upon seclusion or solitude, or into private affairs</p>
<p>2.2 Public disclosure of embarrassing private facts</p>
<p>2.3 Publicity which places a person in a false light in the public eye</p>
<p>2.4 Appropriation of name or likeness.</p>
<h3>3. The State of Privacy in English Law</h3>
<p>3.1 There is currently no freestanding right to privacy in common law. It has also been stated that the European Convention on Human Rights does not require the development of an independent tort of privacy. In the absence of a common law right to privacy in English law torts such as the equitable doctrine breach of confidence, torts linked to the intentional infliction of harm to the person and public law torts relating to the use of police powers have been used to fill a gap in the law. The judiciary has developed the law in an incremental fashion and have resisted the opportunity to create a new tort.</p>
